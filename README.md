# Espied Serenity

This addon adds a rouge planet similar to the one seen in the main menu of the game. It dosen't have much content or a story (at least for now) but I figure out that it is a cool place for hanging out, plus it does feature a little easter egg. However, don't expect frequent updates, I am a busy dude. I hope you like visiting it, any suggestion is welcomed!
